# Usage
## Install tools
These commands install `javascript-unknown-ghcjs-ghc`, `cabal` and `node-minify` to your system.
If you have it, you can skip this step.
```bash
sudo apt-get install npm curl git make

make init-tools # You may be asked for your password because it runs 'sudo npm install -g'.
source ~/.bashrc
```
## Build
```bash
make update
make # or 'make build'
```
## Debug
```bash
make debug # This runs 'make' as well. Run 'make debug' instead of 'make && make debug'.
```
